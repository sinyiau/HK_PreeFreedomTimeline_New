        <h1>The Erosion of Press Freedom in Hong Kong</h1>
        <h2>1997-2025</h2>

        <section class="introductory-text">
            <p>Hong Kong, once a bastion of press freedom in Asia, embarked on a new era in 1997 under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework. Its fundamental rights, including freedom of the press, were enshrined in the Basic Law. The central government promised that this way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years.</p>

            <p>From underlying anxieties and the rise of self-censorship in the early post-handover years to direct attacks on press freedom under legal frameworks, Hong Kong’s media landscape has been completely reshaped.
            </p>
                
            <p>This timeline illustrates how press freedoms have endured for nearly three decades, detailing the systematic erosion marked by evolving legal frameworks, shifting political pressures, and interconnected events. It demonstrates the immense pressures faced by journalists and the importance of maintaining press freedom in Hong Kong's rapidly changing environment, once home to one of Asia's most vibrant media scenes.

                    <h3>Handover of Hong Kong</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hong Kong was known for its vibrant and free media before the 1997 handover<a href="https://thecfhk.org/press-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>, 
                        and the transitional period was described as the time when the city’s press enjoyed an 
                        “unprecedented degree of freedom<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/8009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first few years after 1997, the Beijing government granted a considerable degree of freedom 
                        by relying on “disciplining the Hong Kong press through self-censorship<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2024/12/05/freedom-of-the-press-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>.” 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Then chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Mak Yin-ting, expressed concern<a href="https://ws.mac.gov.tw/001/Upload/295/relfile/8874/79010/1bcf81e4-8150-466b-bf81-7d6638fc2930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a> 
                        about the “Chinese model” of press freedom with which Hong Kong journalists were unfamiliar.

                <h3>Article 23 Legislation Attempt</h3>

                <p>
                    The Hong Kong government pushed for the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which prohibits acts such as treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Central People's Government, as well as the theft of state secrets. 
                    The equivalent national security law sparked concern in the media that it would severely restrict press freedom, particularly with regard to reporting on sensitive issues involving China or criticizing the authorities<a href="https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/0506-7286-2012-1-56.pdf?download_full_pdf=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[5]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On July 1, 2003, an estimated 500,000 people protested against the bill<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/hong-kong-article-23-legislation-a-dangerous-moment-for-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[6]</a>. 
                    This unprecedented level of public opposition demonstrated widespread anxiety about the bill's potential impact on freedom<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2018/02/17/article-23-the-rise-and-fall-of-hong-kongs-2003-national-security-bill-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[7]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Faced with overwhelming public opposition and the collapse of support within the legislature, Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa announced the withdrawal of the bill.

                <h3>The Chill of Self-Censorship</h3>

                <p>
                    Although direct government censorship was not the primary concern at the time, self-censorship in newsrooms was becoming an increasingly prevalent issue<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/8009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[8]</a>, which was often attributed to media owners having business interests in mainland China.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The police's handling of journalists covering large-scale protests at the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in December 2005 also drew criticism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the detention of Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based journalist for Singapore’s The Straits Times, in mainland China in April 2005 on spying allegations heightened anxieties among Hong Kong journalists<a href="https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120229-%E7%A8%8B%E7%BF%94%EF%BC%9A%E5%8D%B7%E5%85%A5%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E6%9C%80%E9%AB%98%E6%9D%83%E4%BA%89%E9%99%B7%E7%8B%B1-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E5%8B%BF%E6%AD%A5%E5%90%8E%E5%B0%98" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[9]</a>.

                <h3>Umbrella Movement and its Toll on Press Freedom </h3>

                <p>
                    Triggered by Beijing’s restrictive framework for electing Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, tens of thousands of Hong Kong people took to the streets. This eventually led to the 79-day pro-democracy street occupation known as the Umbrella Movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                </p>
                    Attacks on journalists became a critical issue during this period<a href="https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/china/2014/10/141004_hk_journalist_attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[10]</a> as local and international reporters covering the protests were subjected to verbal intimidation and physical assault during protests or police operations. The Hong Kong Journalists Association's annual report stated that 2014 was the most dangerous year for journalists' perosnal safety, with more 30 journalists injured in attacks while on the job.<a href="https://www.dw.com/zh/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E8%AE%B0%E8%80%85%E5%8E%BB%E5%B9%B4%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%9C%80%E5%8F%97%E5%A8%81%E8%83%81/a-18579623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[11]</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Existing concerns about self-censorship and editorial independence intensified. Notably, a TVB journalist's voiceover script describing police officers “punching and kicking” a protester was allegedly amended by the management team at Hong Kong’s largest broadcaster. TVB journalists signed a joint petition protesting interference with editorial freedom, and at least seven journalists resigned later<a href="https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB/20150226-%E4%B8%8D%E6%BB%BF%E4%BD%94%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%B1%E9%81%93%E9%81%AD%E4%B8%8A%E9%A0%AD%E5%B9%B2%E9%A0%90%E7%84%A1%E7%B7%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E9%83%A87%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E8%AB%8B%E8%BE%AD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[12]</a>.

                <h3>The Missing Booksellers</h3>

                <p>
                    The drop in RSF's Press Freedom Ranking this year was largely due to the 2014 Umbrella Movement. 

                    In late 2015, five individuals associated with Causeway Bay Books, a bookstore and publishing house known for selling politically sensitive books critical of Chinese leaders, went missing between October and December<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/magazine/the-case-of-hong-kongs-missing-booksellers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[13]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most alarmingly, co-owner Lee Bo vanished from Hong Kong, while co-owner Gui Minhai was abducted in Thailand. 
                    All five later resurfaced in mainland China in the custody of Chinese authorities</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though not directly related to the press, this incident profoundly affected Hong Kong's publishing industry and freedom of expression. 
                    It signaled a new level of risk for those involved in publishing and distributing books critical of Beijing.

                <h3>The Turning Point for Hong Kong’s Press Freedom </h3>

                <p>
                    This year marked a critical turning point for press freedom in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government proposed a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[14]</a>. In response, the people of Hong Kong took to the streets in record-breaking numbers, with up to two million participating in a single demonstration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill protests continued for months. Amidst the challenges of reporting on large-scale protests, journalists also faced attempts from police and sometimes protesters to hinder their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Citizen journalism and independent online platforms played an increasingly significant role in disseminating information and providing alternative perspectives, highlighting both the resilience of the flow of information and the new complexities in the media landscape<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hong-kong/freedom-world/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[15]</a>.
                </p>
        
                <h4>June</h4>
                <p>
                    During the June 12 protest, numerous local and international journalists reported being targeted by police with tear gas and pepper spray, despite being clearly identifiable as press. The HKJA and other press groups documented incidents in which police pushed journalists, fired tear gas at close range at press members, and shined strong lights at cameras<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57925055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[16]</a>.
                </p>
        
                <h4>July</h4>
                <p>
                    Protests against the extradition bill continued. On July 21, a large group of men wearing white T-shirts — some of whom were allegedly connected to triads — indiscriminately attacked pro-democracy protesters, commuters, and journalists in and around the Yuen Long MTR station<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/hong-kong-police-triad-gangs-protesters-yuen-long" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[17]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Journalists were specifically targeted and brutally assaulted while trying to film the attacks. Attackers reportedly snatched cameras, and some journalists sustained significant injuries. For example, Gwyneth Ho, a female journalist from pro-democracy outlet Stand News, was reportedly beaten by multiple men while live-streaming<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/horrifying-moments-as-hong-kong-journalist-live-streams-being-attacked-idUSKCN1UH12M/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[18]</a>.
                </p>
        
                <h4>September</h4>
                <p>
                    Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill. However, allegations of police misconduct and problematic treatment of journalists during protests persisted despite the bill's withdrawal.

                    The HKJA continued to log complaints from journalists and issue statements calling for police restraint and respect for press freedom. International and local press freedom groups issued a joint statement condemning the increasing violence against journalists and police interference<a href="https://hk.epochtimes.com/news/2019-09-13/73704418" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[19]</a>.

                    Several student journalists and some professional reporters were arrested around university campuses that were shut down or became major conflict zones due to protests<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/china-and-tibet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[20]</a>. These arrests raised alarms about the authorities' willingness to detain members of the press covering protests.

                <h3>Hong Kong National Security Law </h3>

               
            <p>
                This year marked an era of unprecedented challenges for press freedom in Hong Kong, primarily due to the enactment and implementation of the National Security Law<a href="https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20202444e/es220202444136.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[21]</a>. The law has fundamentally reshaped the legal and political landscape, creating a climate of fear and uncertainty for journalists and media organizations<a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2023/foci-2023-0007.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[22]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The broad powers granted to authorities under the law contributed to a sense of unease and a shrinking space for free expression and critical reporting<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/china-and-tibet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[23]</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>June</h4>
            <p>
                The "Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” was enacted in Hong Kong and came into force immediately on June 30, bypassing local legislative procedures<a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/hong-kong-freedoms-democracy-protests-china-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[24]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NSL criminalized four broad categories of acts: secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security, with penalties up to life imprisonment. The law's vague definitions of offenses, particularly “collusion with foreign forces” and “subversion,” immediately sparked widespread concern among journalists and human rights groups<a href="https://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/en/topics/a-drained-democracy-the-clash-between-national-security-and-freedom-of-expression-in-hong-kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[25]</a>. Many feared that routine journalistic activities, such as interviewing government critics, collaborating with international NGOs, or publishing critical reports, could be construed as violations of the law.
            </p>
            <p>
                News outlets and individual journalists started practicing self-censorship, avoiding or toning down coverage of sensitive topics<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/725536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[26]</a>. Some organizations reportedly removed archival content, and sources became less willing to speak on sensitive issues due to fears of legal consequences. International news outlets also expressed concern: The New York Times announced plans to relocate parts of their Hong Kong operations to Seoul and other outlets moving their staff to the vibrant democracy of Taiwan.<a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/hongkong-media-press-freedom-standnews-08292024154102.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[27]</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>August</h4>
            <p>
                Jimmy Lai, the founder of the pro-democracy newspaper *Apple Daily*, was arrested under the NSL on allegations of “collusion with foreign forces”<a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/religious-prisoners-conscience/forb-victims-database/jimmy-lai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[28]</a>. Several other executives and Lai's family members were also arrested.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over 200 police officers conducted a large-scale raid on the headquarters of Apple Daily, searching the newsroom and accessing journalistic materials<a href="https://cpj.org/2020/08/hong-kong-police-raid-apple-daily-newsroom-arrest-founder-jimmy-lai-his-sons-and-4-executives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[29]</a>. This unprecedented raid on a major media outlet was widely condemned by local and international press freedom groups as a direct assault on press freedom. These actions were seen as a clear signal that the authorities would use the NSL to silence critical voices in the media.
            </p>

            <h4>November</h4>
            <p>
                The legal pressures on journalists were further highlighted by the case of Bao, Choy Yuk Ling, a freelance RTHK producer. She was arrested and later prosecuted for allegedly making false statements to obtain vehicle registration records used in an investigative documentary about the 2019 Yuen Long attack<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/world/asia/hong-kong-bao-choy-appeal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[30]</a>.

                <h3>Pro-democracy Media Outlets Shut Down </h3>

               
                <p>
                    Hong Kong authorities intensified their crackdown on critical journalism by using the NSL and sedition charges to silence the opposition and create a pervasive climate of fear throughout the industry<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/china-and-tibet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[31]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong was placed under pro-government management, leading to the censorship of programs including the multi-award-winning investigative series, “Hong Kong Connection<a href="https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E6%9C%83%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E/648773/%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%B0%E9%8F%97%E9%8F%98%E9%9B%86-%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF-%E5%8E%9F%E7%8F%AD%E5%BA%953%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E9%9B%A2%E8%81%B7-6%E5%90%88%E7%B4%84%E7%B7%A8%E5%B0%8E%E8%A2%AB%E9%80%9A%E7%9F%A5%E4%B8%8D%E7%94%A8%E4%B8%8A%E7%8F%AD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[32]</a>.” More than 10 other independent media outlets have closed down for fear of legal action. 
                </p>
        
                <h4>June</h4>
                <p>
                    Apple Daily, Hong Kong’s most popular pro-democracy newspaper, was forced to announce its closure, marking one of the most significant blows to press freedom<a href="https://rsf.org/en/hong-kong-rsf-appalled-prolonged-detention-apple-daily-staff-three-years-after-media-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[33]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hundreds of police officers raided the newspaper's headquarters for a second time and arrested five senior executives, including the chief editor and CEO, on allegations of "colluding with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security" under the NSL. Authorities cited numerous articles published by the paper as evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A significant amount of the company’s assets, reportedly valued at US$2.3 million, were frozen by the authorities. Unable to pay staff or operational costs, the newspaper announced its final print edition on June 24<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/hong-kong-apple-daily-queue-final-edition-newspaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[34]</a>. The closure of a major newspaper due to direct government action under the NSL sent a chilling message to all media outlets about the new “red lines.”
                </p>
        
                <h4>December</h4>
                <p>
                    Stand News, a prominent pro-democracy online news outlet that gained a significant readership after the 2019 protests, was raided by around 200 police officers. Seven current and former senior staff members, including editors and board members were arrested on suspicion of "conspiracy to publish seditious publication"<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/point-no-return-fall-stand-news-hong-kongs-once-leading-online-media-outlet-2024-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[35]</a>. The company’s assets were also frozen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the same day as the arrests, Stand News announced that it would immediately cease operations and remove all its online content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just days later, in early January 2022, another independent online outlet, Citizen News, announced it would also cease operations. The founders cited the increasingly difficult media environment and concerns for the safety of their staff in the wake of the Stand News raid as reasons for their decision, stating they could no longer operate without fear<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-citizen-news-says-closure-triggered-by-stand-news-collapse-2022-01-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[36]</a>.

                <h3>Domestic Security Law Deepens Press Freedom Uncertainty </h3>

                <p>
                    Hong Kong’s press continues to operate under the profound shadow of the National Security Law. Journalists and media outlets must navigate vaguely defined red lines, which has led to a reluctance to cover topics that are considered sensitive by Beijing or the Hong Kong authorities.</p>
                <p>
                   The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong released a survey <a href="https://www.fcchk.org/fcc-statement-on-results-of-fccs-press-freedom-survey-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[37]</a> indicating that a significant majority of responding members were concerned about the NSL and had increased their self-censorship. Many journalists reported difficulty sourcing information on sensitive topics.

                </figure>

                <h3>Navigating "Red Lines" </h3>

                <p>
                    The once withdrawn “Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”, known as Article 23, was passed in a unanimous vote in the Lesgislative Council and came into effect in March<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/what-is-hong-kongs-article-23-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[38]</a>. This domestic national security legislation further expands the legal threats journalists face, including offenses such as “espionage,” “theft of state secrets” and “external interference.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provisions regarding “state secrets” are of particular concern to journalists. The definition is broad and could cover a wide range of government, economic, social, and technological information that is not directly related to traditional security matters. Journalists who handle or publish such information, even if it is obtained through leaks and is in the public interest, could face severe penalties.
                </p>

               <p> In February, Hong Kong’s security chief publicly accused Radio Free Asia of spreading “false criticism” about the law and labeled it a “foreign force.” Soon after, RFA closed its Hong Kong bureau, citing mounting legal threats and concerns over staff safety. RFA’s president Bay Fang, stated<a href="hhttps://www.usagm.gov/2024/03/29/rfa-president-hong-kong-bureau-to-restructure-in-light-of-article-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[39]</a> that actions by Hong Kong authorities raised serious questions about their “ability to operate in safety with the enactment of Article 23.”</p>

                <p></p>On World Press Freedom Day 2025, the Hong Kong Journalist Association launched its “Media 360” website <a href="https://media360.hkja.org.hk/#/journalists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[40]</a>, noting that 49 journalists had been arrested or imprisoned since the implementation of the NSL and Article 23, including 16 under national security or sedition-related offenses.</p>
