                    <h3>Handover of Hong Kong</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hong Kong was known for its vibrant and free media before the 1997 handover<a href="https://thecfhk.org/press-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>, 
                        and the transitional period was described as the time when the city’s press enjoyed an 
                        “unprecedented degree of freedom<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/8009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the first few years after 1997, the Beijing government granted a considerable degree of freedom 
                        by relying on “disciplining the Hong Kong press through self-censorship<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2024/12/05/freedom-of-the-press-in-hong-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>.” 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Then chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Mak Yin-ting, expressed concern<a href="https://ro.uow.edu.au/artspapers/747/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a> 
                        about the “Chinese model” of press freedom with which Hong Kong journalists were unfamiliar.

                <h3>Article 23 Legislation Attempt</h3>

                <p>
                    The Hong Kong government pushed for the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law, which prohibits acts such as treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the Central People's Government, as well as the theft of state secrets<a href="https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_2.html#P2_23_20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>. 
                    The equivalent national security law sparked concern in the media that it would severely restrict press freedom, particularly with regard to reporting on sensitive issues involving China or criticizing the authorities<a href="https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/0506-7286-2012-1-56.pdf?download_full_pdf=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On July 1, 2003, an estimated 500,000 people protested against the bill<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/hong-kong-article-23-legislation-a-dangerous-moment-for-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>. 
                    This unprecedented level of public opposition demonstrated widespread anxiety about the bill's potential impact on freedom<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2018/02/17/article-23-the-rise-and-fall-of-hong-kongs-2003-national-security-bill-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Faced with overwhelming public opposition and the collapse of support within the legislature, Hong Kong's first Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa announced the withdrawal of the bill<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2018/02/17/article-23-the-rise-and-fall-of-hong-kongs-2003-national-security-bill-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[5]</a>.

                <h3>The Chill of Self-Censorship</h3>

                <p>
                    Although direct government censorship was not the primary concern at the time, self-censorship in newsrooms was becoming an increasingly prevalent issue<a href="https://journals.openedition.org/chinaperspectives/8009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>, which was often attributed to media owners having business interests in mainland China<a href="https://www.ifj.org/fileadmin/user_upload/2006_IFJ_China_Press_Freedom_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A 2006 report by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) highlighted that while Hong Kong's media remained “boisterous and competitive,” the shadow of Beijing’s influence was palpable. This led to caution and self-censorship, particularly on issues deemed sensitive by the central government<a href="https://www.ifj.org/fileadmin/user_upload/2006_IFJ_China_Press_Freedom_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The police's handling of journalists covering large-scale protests at the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in December 2005 also drew criticism<a href="https://www.hkja.org.hk/en/statements/joint-statement-on-police-brutality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the detention of Ching Cheong, a Hong Kong-based journalist for Singapore’s *The Straits Times*, in mainland China in April 2005 on spying allegations heightened anxieties among Hong Kong journalists<a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2020/05/03/press-freedom-in-hong-kong-a-slow-motion-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[5]</a>.

                <h3>Umbrella Movement and its Toll on Press Freedom </h3>

                <p>
                    Triggered by Beijing’s restrictive framework for electing Hong Kong’s Chief Executive<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hong-kong/freedom-world/2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>, tens of thousands of Hong Kong people took to the streets. This eventually led to the 79-day pro-democracy street occupation known as the Umbrella Movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attacks on journalists became a critical issue during this period<a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/hong-kong-press-freedom-report-reveals-year-of-fear-for-journalists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a> as local and international reporters covering the protests were subjected to verbal intimidation and physical assault. Some reported being manhandled, hit by pepper spray, and had their reporting unreasonably restricted during police operations<a href="https://cpj.org/2014/10/journalists-under-fire-during-hong-kong-protests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Existing concerns about self-censorship and editorial independence intensified. Notably, a TVB journalist's voiceover script describing police officers “punching and kicking” a protester was allegedly amended by the management team at Hong Kong’s largest broadcaster. TVB journalists signed a joint petition protesting interference with editorial freedom, and at least seven journalists resigned later<a href="https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB/20150226-%E4%B8%8D%E6%BB%BF%E4%BD%94%E4%B8%AD%E5%A0%B1%E9%81%93%E9%81%AD%E4%B8%8A%E9%A0%AD%E5%B9%B2%E9%A0%90%E7%84%A1%E7%B7%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%A6%96%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E9%83%A87%E8%A8%98%E8%80%85%E8%AB%8B%E8%BE%AD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[6]</a>.

                <h3>The Missing Booksellers</h3>

                <p>
                    The drop in RSF's Press Freedom Ranking this year (reflecting 2014 events) was largely due to the 2014 Umbrella Movement<a href="https://rsf.org/en/rsfs-2015-world-press-freedom-index-notable-falls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>. 
                    In late 2015, five individuals associated with Causeway Bay Books, a bookstore and publishing house known for selling politically sensitive books critical of Chinese leaders, went missing between October and December<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/21/bringing-beijing-hong-kong/abductions-chilling-effect-free-speech-hong-kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most alarmingly, co-owner Lee Bo vanished from Hong Kong, while co-owner Gui Minhai was abducted in Thailand<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/01/hong-kong-bookseller-latest-to-disappear-feared-detained-by-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>. 
                    All five later resurfaced in mainland China in the custody of Chinese authorities<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/21/bringing-beijing-hong-kong/abductions-chilling-effect-free-speech-hong-kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though not directly related to the press, this incident profoundly affected Hong Kong's publishing industry and freedom of expression<a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/21/bringing-beijing-hong-kong/abductions-chilling-effect-free-speech-hong-kong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[5]</a>. 
                    It signaled a new level of risk for those involved in publishing and distributing books critical of Beijing.

                <h3>The Turning Point for Hong Kong’s Press Freedom </h3>

                <p>
                    This year marked a critical turning point for press freedom in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government proposed a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[1]</a>. In response, the people of Hong Kong took to the streets in record-breaking numbers, with up to two million participating in a single demonstration<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-PROTESTS/0100B0D40T5/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[2]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) protests continued for months. Amidst the challenges of reporting on large-scale protests, journalists also faced attempts from police and sometimes protesters to hinder their work<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/14/hong-kong-year-protest-ravaged-freedoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[3]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Citizen journalism and independent online platforms played an increasingly significant role in disseminating information and providing alternative perspectives, highlighting both the resilience of the flow of information and the new complexities in the media landscape<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hong-kong/freedom-world/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[4]</a>.
                </p>
        
                <h4>June</h4>
                <p>
                    During the June 12 protest, numerous local and international journalists reported being targeted by police with tear gas and pepper spray, despite being clearly identifiable as press<a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/hong-kong-ifj-condemns-police-violence-against-journalists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[5]</a>. The HKJA and other press groups documented incidents in which police pushed journalists, fired tear gas at close range at press members, and shined strong lights at cameras<a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/hong-kong-ifj-condemns-police-violence-against-journalists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[6]</a>.
                </p>
        
                <h4>July</h4>

                    Protests against the extradition bill continued. On July 21, a large group of men wearing white T-shirts — some of whom were allegedly connected to triads — indiscriminately attacked pro-democracy protesters, commuters, and journalists in and around the Yuen Long MTR station<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/hong-kong-police-triad-gangs-protesters-yuen-long" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[7]</a>.

                    Journalists were specifically targeted and brutally assaulted while trying to film the attacks. Attackers reportedly snatched cameras, and some journalists sustained significant injuries. For example, Gwyneth Ho, a female journalist from pro-democracy outlet Stand News, was reportedly beaten by multiple men while live-streaming<a href="https://cpj.org/2019/07/attacks-on-hong-kong-journalists-escalate-amid-p/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[8]</a>.

                    The HKJA continued to log complaints from journalists and issue statements calling for police restraint and respect for press freedom. Seven international and local press freedom groups issued a joint statement condemning the increasing violence against journalists and police interference<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49722363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[11]</a>.

                <p>
                    Several student journalists and some professional reporters were arrested around university campuses that were shut down or became major conflict zones due to protests<a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2020/country-chapters/china-and-tibet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="source-link">[12]</a>. These arrests raised alarms about the authorities' willingness to detain members of the press covering protests.
